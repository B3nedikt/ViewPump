# ViewPump 4.0.5

View inflation you can intercept using an API of pre/post-inflation interceptors.

## Getting started

### Dependency

Include the dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {

    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'

    implementation 'dev.b3nedikt.viewpump:viewpump:4.0.5'
}
```

### Usage

Define your interceptor. Below is a somewhat arbitrary example of a post-inflation interceptor that prefixes the text in a TextView.

```java
public class TextUpdatingInterceptor implements Interceptor {

  @Override
  public InflateResult intercept(Chain chain) {
    InflateResult result = chain.proceed(chain.request());
    if (result.view() instanceof TextView) {
      // Do something to result.view()
      // You have access to result.context() and result.attrs()
      TextView textView = (TextView) result.view();
      textView.setText("[Prefix] " + textView.getText());
    }
    return result;
  }
}
```

Below is an example of a pre-inflation interceptor that returns a CustomTextView when a TextView was defined in the layout's XML.

```java
public class CustomTextViewInterceptor implements Interceptor {

  @NotNull
  @Override
  public InflateResult intercept(Chain chain) {
    InflateRequest request = chain.request();
    View view = inflateView(
      request.getName(),
      request.getContext(),
      request.getAttrs()
    );

    if (view != null) {
      return new InflateResult(
        view,
        request.getName(),
        request.getContext(),
        request.getAttrs()
      );
    } else {
      return chain.proceed(request);
    }
  }

  @Nullable
  private View inflateView(String name, Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    if ("TextView".equals(name)) {
      return new CustomTextView(context, attrs);
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Installation

Add your interceptors to the `ViewPump.builder()`, in your `Application` class in the `#onCreate()` method and `init` the `ViewPump`. The order of the interceptors is important since they form the interceptor chain of requests and results.

An interceptor may choose to return a programmatically instantiated view rather than letting the default inflation occur, in which case interceptors added after it will be skipped. For this reason, it is better to add your post-inflation interceptors before the pre-inflation interceptors

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    ViewPump.init(new TextUpdatingInterceptor(), new CustomTextViewInterceptor());
    //....
}
```

### Inject into Context

Add the following to your base activitiy:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private AppCompatDelegate appCompatDelegate = null;

    ...

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public AppCompatDelegate getDelegate() {
        if (appCompatDelegate == null) {
            appCompatDelegate = new ViewPumpAppCompatDelegate(
                    super.getDelegate(),
                    this
            );
        }
        return appCompatDelegate;
    }
}
```

## Collaborators

This library was originally created by:

- [@jbarr21](https://github.com/jbarr21)
- [@chrisjenx](https://github.com/chrisjenx)

My fork has nearly all the code changed though and has a slightly different API.
